# Day 9 – SQL Analytics & Dashboards

## Objective
Build analytical SQL queries and convert them into an interactive dashboard using Databricks SQL.

## Key Learnings
- SQL Warehouses for analytics execution
- Analytical SQL using aggregations and window functions
- Dashboard creation using SQL query outputs
- Basic interactivity using dashboard filters
- Understanding platform limitations in Community Edition

## Tasks Completed
- Created and used a SQL Warehouse
- Wrote analytical SQL queries (aggregations & window functions)
- Built a Databricks SQL dashboard (table, bar chart, pie chart)
- Added interactive filters
- Scheduling concept understood (not available in Community Edition)

## Notes
Dashboard scheduling is not supported in Databricks Community Edition. In a production environment, this dashboard would be scheduled for automated refresh using a SQL Warehouse.
